# Tic Tac Warfare Prototype

This folder contains a simplified ruleset and printable artwork for creating a tabletop prototype of **Tic Tac Warfare**. The goal is to provide a more balanced experience while keeping the spirit of the digital version.

## Components

- **6x6 Game Board** – use `artwork/board.svg` for printing.
- **X and O Tokens** – print `artwork/tokens.svg` on thick paper or cardboard and cut them out.
- **Ability Cards** – print `artwork/ability_cards.svg` and cut out one set for each player to track their abilities.
- **Rule Sheet** – see below for the balanced ruleset.

## Balanced Ruleset

### Setup
1. Each player chooses a color (Red for **X**, Blue for **O**).
2. Give each player the following abilities:
   - **Bomb ×1** – remove an opponent token plus its four orthogonal neighbours.
   - **Shield ×1** – protect one token from Bomb or Convert effects until the player's next turn.
   - **Convert ×1** – change any single enemy token to your own.
   - **Fortress ×1** – place a special fortress token; counts towards fortress victory.
3. Shuffle any ability cards and place them face up near each player.
4. Decide randomly who goes first.

### Turn
1. Place one of your tokens on an empty space.
2. Optionally play **one** ability card before or after placing your token. Discard the card after use.
3. Check for any victory condition. If none are met, play passes to the opponent.

### Victory Conditions
A player wins immediately if **any** of these are achieved:
- **Line Victory** – six of your tokens in a straight line (row, column or diagonal).
- **Fortress Victory** – three of your fortress tokens on the board.
- **Territory Victory** – when the board is full, the player with more tokens wins. A tie results in a stalemate.

### Balance Notes
- Each ability can only be used once per game, creating meaningful decision points.
- Limiting the Bomb to a small cross pattern and Convert to a single token prevents runaway swings.
- A single Fortress token per player encourages tactical placement without overwhelming the board.

## Printing Tips
- The supplied SVGs can be resized without losing quality.
- When printing the tokens, consider using different coloured paper for each player.
- Sleeved playing cards work well for ability cards – simply print and cut.
